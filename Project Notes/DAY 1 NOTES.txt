📘 **DAY 1 NOTES — Setup, Git, and First Python App



## **1️⃣ Creating the Project Folder**

You created the folder:

```
ai-knowledge-assistant/
```

This is your entire project home.

---

## **2️⃣ Creating basic files**

### ✔️ `README.md`

Explains what your project is about.

### ✔️ `.gitignore`

Tells Git which files *not* to track (like venv, cache, etc.)

### ✔️ `requirements.txt`

Contains Python packages you will install later (sentence-transformers, etc.)

---

## **3️⃣ Creating Your First Python File (`app.py`)**

Path:

```
src/app.py
```

### 👉 Code you wrote:

```python
def main():
    print("👋 Hi Sahi, welcome to your AI Knowledge Assistant project!")
    print("This is the starting point of our app.")
    print("We'll slowly turn this into a real RAG-based assistant.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### 💡 Explanation:

* `def main():`
  Defines a function called `main()` — the starting point of your app.

* `print(...)`
  Displays text in the terminal.

* `if __name__ == "__main__":`
  Python runs this block only when you execute the file directly.

This is standard for Python applications.

---

## 4️⃣ Running the App

You ran:

```bash
python src/app.py
```

You saw:

```
👋 Hi Sahi, welcome to your AI Knowledge Assistant project!
...
```

If nothing prints → file was not saved → you fixed this.

---

## 5️⃣ Initializing Git

To start tracking your project with Git:

```bash
git init
```

* Creates a hidden `.git` folder
* Turns your folder into a Git repository
* Git now tracks all file changes

---

## 6️⃣ Staging & Committing

### Stage:

```bash
git add .
```

Means: “Git, pay attention to these files.”

### Commit:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial setup: project skeleton with app.py and basic files"
```

Means:
“Save all these staged changes permanently.”

This is your first snapshot.

---

## 7️⃣ Connecting to GitHub

You created a repo:

```
https://github.com/SahithyaGodishala838/ai-knowledge-assistant
```

Then linked your local repo:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/SahithyaGodishala838/ai-knowledge-assistant.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Now your project lives both:

* locally
* and on GitHub (for anyone to view or clone)
