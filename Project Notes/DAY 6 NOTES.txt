📘 Day 6 Notes

## AI Knowledge Assistant Project

### (Options A–D)

---

## 🔹 Day 6 Overview

**Objective of Day 6:**
Transform the AI Knowledge Assistant from a working RAG prototype into a **professional, portfolio-grade application** by improving:

* Retrieval quality
* Document coverage (TXT + DOCX + PDF-ready)
* Answer clarity and UX
* Web-based user interface

By the end of Day 6, the project supports:

* CLI + Web UI
* Multi-document RAG
* Explainable answers with sources
* Clean Git milestone commit

---

# 🅰️ Option A — Retrieval Quality Upgrade

### 🎯 Goal

Improve **answer accuracy** by improving **retrieval**, not by changing LLMs.

---

### 🔧 Key Improvements Implemented

#### 1️⃣ Sentence-aware chunking

* Earlier: chunks were split by raw character count
* Now: text is split by **sentences**, preserving meaning

**Why this matters:**
Embeddings represent semantic meaning better when sentences are intact.

---

#### 2️⃣ Chunk overlap

* Each chunk carries over the last few sentences from the previous chunk

**Benefit:**
Prevents loss of context across chunk boundaries.

---

#### 3️⃣ Similarity threshold

* Retrieval now filters out chunks below a similarity score (e.g., 0.20–0.30)

**Benefit:**

* Reduces irrelevant context
* Prevents hallucinations
* Improves final answer quality

---

#### 4️⃣ Metadata-aware retrieval

Each chunk stores:

* `doc_name`
* `chunk_id`
* `similarity score`
* `text`

This enables:

* Source attribution
* Debugging retrieval quality
* Explainability (important for enterprise AI)

---

### 🧠 Key Learning

> In RAG systems, **retrieval quality matters more than the LLM choice**.

---

# 🅱️ Option B — Multi-Document Support (TXT + DOCX + PDF)

### 🎯 Goal

Allow the assistant to read **real-world documents** like resumes and reports.

---

### 📂 New Capability

The assistant now loads documents from:

```
data/documents/
```

Supported formats:

* `.txt`
* `.docx`
* `.pdf` (text-based)

---

### 🧩 document_loader.py

A new loader handles:

* TXT via UTF-8 read
* DOCX via `python-docx`
* PDF via `pypdf`

Each document is returned as:

```python
{
  "name": file_name,
  "content": extracted_text,
  "type": "txt/docx/pdf"
}
```

---

### 🔀 Index Build Modes

`build_index.py` now supports **modes**:

* TXT only:

```bash
python src/build_index.py
```

* All documents:

```bash
python src/build_index.py all
```

**Why this is good design:**

* Flexible
* Backward-compatible
* No destructive changes

---

### 🧠 Key Learning

> A good RAG system separates **document ingestion** from **retrieval logic**.

---

# 🅲 Option C — UX & Answer Quality Improvements

### 🎯 Goal

Make answers **clear, readable, and trustworthy**, even without external LLM APIs.

---

### 🔧 Improvements Made

#### 1️⃣ Improved retrieval for broad questions

* Lowered similarity threshold for questions like:

  * “Summarize my resume”
  * “What is this document about?”

---

#### 2️⃣ Improved local answer generation

Earlier:

* Local mode echoed the prompt (not helpful)

Now:

* Extracts retrieved context
* Produces a **concise, extractive summary**
* Handles “no context” gracefully

Example behavior:

* If chunks exist → summarized answer
* If no chunks → “I don’t know”

---

#### 3️⃣ Clear source display

* Shows:

  * Document name
  * Similarity score
  * Chunk preview

**Why this matters:**

* Builds trust
* Enables explainability
* Matches enterprise AI expectations

---

### 🧠 Key Learning

> UX and answer formatting are just as important as model accuracy.

---

# 🅳 Option D — Streamlit Web Application

### 🎯 Goal

Turn the CLI-based assistant into a **real web app**.

---

### 🌐 Streamlit UI Features

* Web-based interface
* Sidebar controls:

  * LLM provider selection
  * Top-K retrieval slider
* Question input box
* Answer display
* Retrieved source display

---

### 📄 app_streamlit.py

* Lives in project root
* Uses the same `rag_pipeline`
* Adds minimal UI code without duplicating logic

---

### 🔧 Import Strategy (Non-destructive)

Instead of rewriting all imports:

* Added a **path bootstrap** in `app_streamlit.py`
* Allowed both:

  * CLI execution
  * Streamlit execution

**Benefit:**
One codebase → multiple entry points.

---

### 🧠 Key Learning

> Production-ready projects support multiple execution environments without duplicating logic.

---
